Various common problems solved in python.

TODO: need to write 1 line description of all files in the below format, here is a start.

- custom-dictionary-sort - Sort the input character array based on the dictionary given.

- repeated-elements - Finding a maximum of k-1 most repeated elements, repeated n/k times from a set n. Run time O(n) and space complexity O(k).

- hr-two-arrays - https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/two-arrays
You are given two integer arrays, A and B, each containing N integers. The size of the array is <= 1000. You are free to permute the order of the elements in the arrays.
Now for the real question - is there an arrangement of the arrays such that Ai+Bi>=K for all i where Ai denotes the ith element in the array A.

- hr-pairs - https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/pairs
Given N integers [N<=10^5], count the total pairs of integers that have a difference of K. [K>0 and K<1e9]. Each of the N integers will be greater than 0 and at least K away from 2^31-1 (Everything can be done with 32 bit integers).

- code-formatter - program acts as code formatter
 . reads an input file named input.txt and ensures no more than SIZE number of chars per line are present
 . if more chars than SIZE(max_limit) are present then split at space, insert / wherever we want to split
 . if space is found after the SIZE allowed chars, split after. Let us say SIZE is 5 and space is found at 7th, 	split at 7th
 . output is written to output.txt
 . see code and input.txt for various cases
