- custom-dictionary-sort - Sort the input character array based on the dictionary given.

- repeated-elements - Finding a maximum of k-1 most repeated elements, repeated n/k times from a set n. Run time O(n) and space complexity O(k).

You are given two integer arrays, A and B, each containing N integers. The size of the array is <= 1000. You are free to permute the order of the elements in the arrays.
Now for the real question - is there an arrangement of the arrays such that Ai+Bi>=K for all i where Ai denotes the ith element in the array A.

Given N integers [N<=10^5], count the total pairs of integers that have a difference of K. [K>0 and K<1e9]. Each of the N integers will be greater than 0 and at least K away from 2^31-1 (Everything can be done with 32 bit integers).
